# OverLoading_In_CPP
## Aim 
To study and implement different overloading methods in C++.
## Theory & Algorithms
### Operator Overloading
C++ has the ability to provide the operators with a special meaning for particular data type, this ability is known as operator overloading. For example, we can make use of the addition operator (+) for string to concatenate two strings and for integer to add two integers. The << and >> operator are binary shift operators but are also used with input and output streams. This is possible due to operator overloading. 
### Constructor Overloading
Constructor overloading in C++ allows a class to have multiple constructors, each with a distinct signature. The signature of a constructor is determined by the number, type, and order of its parameters. This flexibility enables objects of the class to be initialized in various ways, depending on the specific arguments provided during object creation. 
### Function Overloading
Function overloading is a feature of object-oriented programming where two or more functions can have the same name but behave differently for different parameters. Such functions are said to be overloaded; hence, this is known as Function Overloading. Functions can be overloaded either by changing the number of arguments or changing the type of arguments.
## Conclusion
We learnt to use 3 different methods on overloading in C++.
